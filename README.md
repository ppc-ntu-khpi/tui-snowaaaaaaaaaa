## Bank Customer Details
### Dvorovenko Max
This project is a part of the assignment to rewrite the ShowCustomerDetails method using the classes Bank, Customer, and Account from previous labs. The objective is to ensure that the bank has at least two customers, and the information about them (including their first accounts) can be viewed by entering the customer's number. You can either use the classes from the provided repository or import a jar file containing all necessary classes as a library.
